1. Difference between ^ and ~ in package.json
---------------------------------------------
The semvar format is: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH


Example:

^ (caret) — safe feature updates (most common)

Example:
```
"react": "^18.2.0"
```

Allows updates that do not change the MAJOR version.

✔ Allowed version updates:

18.2.1

18.5.0

18.999.999


❌ Version updates that are Not allowed:

19.0.0

👉 Meaning:
Accept bug fixes and new features, but no breaking changes.

===========================================================================

~ (tilde) — bug-fix only

Example:

```
"react": "~18.2.0"
```

Allows updates that change only the PATCH version.

✔ Allowed version updates with ~ in package.json for package versions include:

18.2.1

18.2.9

❌ with "~" the version updates that are not Not allowed are:

18.3.0

19.0.0

👉 Meaning:
Accept bug fixes only.

=================================================================================

package-lock.json is a lock file that records the exact versions of every installed dependency and sub-dependency.

It guarantees:

“This project will install the same dependency tree on every machine.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Who generates package-lock.json?

👉 npm generates it automatically


Created or updated when you run:
```
npm install
```

You should commit it to Git.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Why package-lock.json exists (real problem it solves)

Even if package.json says:

```
"react": "^18.2.0"
```

Two developers could get:

You → 18.2.0

Teammate → 18.3.1

Because ^ allows updates.

📌 package-lock.json freezes the resolved versions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Difference between package.json and package-lock.json
package.json	        package-lock.json
-------------------------------------------------
Project metadata	Dependency snapshot
Version ranges (^, ~)	Exact versions
Manually edited	        Auto-generated
Used for intent	        Used for reproducibility
Required	        Required for teams

---------------------------------------------------------------------
6. How npm uses both together

package.json → what versions are allowed
package-lock.json → what versions are installed

```
npm install:
```

Respects lock file first
Falls back to package.json if missing

^ allows minor and patch updates, while ~ allows only patch updates.
package.json defines allowed dependency ranges, and package-lock.json locks the exact resolved versions.
The lock file is generated by npm to ensure reproducible installs across environments.
